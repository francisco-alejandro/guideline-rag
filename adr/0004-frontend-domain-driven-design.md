# ADR-0004: Frontend Domain-Driven Design with Layered Architecture and IoC

## Title

Frontend Domain-Driven Design with Layered Architecture and Inversion of Control

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our frontend application needs to maintain a clean separation of concerns and encapsulate business logic effectively while ensuring technology independence and reusability. We need an architecture that allows us to:

1. Share business logic between different frontend applications and frameworks
2. Easily switch between different UI technologies (React, Vue, Angular)
3. Maintain testability and maintainability
4. Support different state management and API integration patterns

## Decision

We will implement a layered architecture with Inversion of Control (IoC) for the frontend application using Inversify:

### Frontend Architecture

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, value objects, domain services, and domain models
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases, commands, queries, application services, and state management
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains UI components, network services, external integrations, and framework-specific implementations
- **IoC Container**: Using Inversify for dependency injection, allowing us to:
  - Inject domain and application services into UI components
  - Easily swap implementations (e.g., different API clients, state management)
  - Reuse domain and application logic across different React apps or other frameworks
  - Decouple business logic from UI framework specifics

### Technology Independence

- **Framework Independence**: Domain and application layers can be reused across different frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- **State Management Flexibility**: Application layer can adapt to different state management patterns (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- **API Integration**: Infrastructure layer can adapt to different API patterns (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Technology Independence**: Business logic is completely decoupled from specific UI frameworks, allowing easy migration between different tools and frameworks
- **Code Reusability**: Domain and application layers can be shared between different frontend applications
- **Testability**: IoC containers make it easy to inject mocks and test business logic in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different implementations (e.g., different state management libraries) without affecting business logic
- **Framework Agnostic**: Business logic can be reused across React, Vue, Angular, or other frameworks

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: Setting up IoC containers and layered architecture requires more upfront development time
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand IoC principles and layered architecture patterns
- **Boilerplate Code**: More setup code is required for dependency injection and layer separation

### Neutral

- **Performance**: IoC containers add minimal overhead while providing significant architectural benefits
- **Project Structure**: More structured approach compared to traditional monolithic frontend applications

## Alternatives Considered

- **Redux-Centric Architecture**: Rejected as it would tightly couple the application to a specific state management solution
- **Monolithic Frontend Architecture**: Rejected as it would limit reusability and technology independence
