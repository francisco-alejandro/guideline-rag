# ADR-0003: Backend Domain-Driven Design with Layered Architecture and IoC

## Title

Backend Domain-Driven Design with Layered Architecture and Inversion of Control

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our backend application needs to maintain a clean separation of concerns and encapsulate business logic effectively while ensuring technology independence and reusability. We need an architecture that allows us to:

1. Easily switch between different technologies (e.g., Supabase to Prisma ORM)
2. Maintain testability and maintainability
3. Support different backend technologies and frameworks
4. Handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations efficiently

## Decision

We will implement a layered architecture with Inversion of Control (IoC) for the backend application using NestJS:

### Backend Architecture

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, repository interfaces, domain services, and domain events
- **Application Layer**: Contains command/query handlers, application services, use cases, and sagas
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains controllers, database implementations, external service integrations, and serializers
- **IoC Container**: Using NestJS dependency injection and providers, enabling:
  - Clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns
  - Easy testing through dependency injection
  - Flexible database implementations (Supabase, Prisma, etc.)
  - Modular service registration and configuration

### Technology Independence

- **Database Layer**: Currently using Supabase client, but the architecture allows easy migration to Prisma ORM for database management and migrations
- **Framework Independence**: Domain and application layers can be reused across different backend technologies
- **API Flexibility**: Infrastructure layer can adapt to different API patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Technology Independence**: Business logic is completely decoupled from specific technologies, allowing easy migration between different tools and frameworks
- **Code Reusability**: Domain and application layers can be shared between different backend applications
- **Testability**: IoC containers make it easy to inject mocks and test business logic in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different implementations (e.g., Supabase to Prisma) without affecting business logic
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: Setting up IoC containers and layered architecture requires more upfront development time
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand IoC principles and layered architecture patterns
- **Boilerplate Code**: More setup code is required for dependency injection and layer separation

### Neutral

- **Performance**: IoC containers add minimal overhead while providing significant architectural benefits
- **Project Structure**: More structured approach compared to traditional monolithic applications

## Alternatives Considered

- **Monolithic Architecture**: Rejected as it would limit reusability and technology independence
