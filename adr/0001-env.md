# ADR-0001: Use .env Files for Local Environment Dependencies

## Title

Use .env Files for Local Environment Dependencies

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires managing various environment-specific configurations and sensitive information such as:

- Database credentials
- API keys
- Service endpoints
- Feature flags
- Other environment-specific variables

We need a secure and maintainable way to handle these configurations across different environments (development, staging, production) while keeping sensitive information out of version control.

## Decision

We will use `.env` files to manage local environment dependencies with the following structure:

1. `.env.example` - Template file committed to version control containing all required environment variables with placeholder values
2. `.env` - Local environment file (git-ignored) containing actual values

For the frontend (Next.js application), we will use Next.js built-in environment variable support which automatically loads `.env` files.

For the backend (NestJS application), we will use the `@nestjs/config` package with ConfigModule to load and validate environment variables from `.env` files.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation between code and configuration
- Easy to maintain different configurations for different environments
- Sensitive information is kept out of version control
- New team members can quickly set up their local environment by copying `.env.example`
- Follows the twelve-factor app methodology for configuration
- Reduces the risk of accidentally committing sensitive information

### Negative

- Need to ensure `.env` files are properly git-ignored
- Team members need to maintain their own `.env` files
- Could lead to environment-specific bugs if not properly managed
- Requires additional setup for new team members

### Neutral

- `.env` files are a widely adopted standard
- Multiple environment files might be needed for different scenarios
- Documentation needs to be kept up to date with new environment variables

## Alternatives Considered

- Using a configuration management service (e.g., AWS Parameter Store, HashiCorp Vault)
  - Rejected due to added complexity and overhead for local development
- Hardcoding configuration in the application
  - Rejected due to security concerns and lack of flexibility
- Using command-line arguments
  - Rejected due to complexity in managing multiple variables
- Using a database for configuration
  - Rejected due to added complexity and potential circular dependencies
