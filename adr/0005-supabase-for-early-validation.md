# ADR-0005: Use Supabase for Early Product Validation

## Title

Use Supabase for Early Product Validation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the early stages of the project, we need to validate the product concept without investing significant effort in infrastructure setup. We need a database solution that allows us to:

- Quickly get started with data persistence
- Focus on product validation rather than infrastructure management
- Have a simple development experience
- Avoid the complexity of setting up and maintaining a PostgreSQL instance

## Decision

We will use Supabase as our database solution during the early validation phase of the project. This decision is based on:

1. **Rapid Setup**: Supabase provides a managed PostgreSQL database that can be set up quickly without infrastructure management overhead
2. **Easy Development**: The Supabase client provides a straightforward API for database operations
3. **Product Focus**: Allows the team to focus on validating the product concept rather than managing database infrastructure
4. **Cost Effective**: Free tier available for development and early validation

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Fast Time to Market**: No need to set up and configure PostgreSQL instances
- **Reduced Infrastructure Overhead**: Managed service handles backups, scaling, and maintenance
- **Simple Development Experience**: Easy-to-use client library with good documentation
- **Built-in Features**: Authentication, real-time subscriptions, and API generation out of the box
- **Cost Effective**: Free tier sufficient for early validation phase

### Negative

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on Supabase's platform and pricing
- **Limited Control**: Less control over database configuration and optimization
- **Migration Complexity**: Future migration to self-hosted PostgreSQL will require effort
- **Feature Limitations**: May be constrained by Supabase's feature set and limits

### Neutral

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Supabase-specific patterns and APIs
- **Future Migration**: Will need to plan migration strategy when moving to production solution

## Alternatives Considered

- **Self-hosted PostgreSQL**: Rejected due to infrastructure overhead and complexity

## Future Migration Strategy

When the product is validated and ready for production, we plan to migrate to a solution like Prisma with a self-hosted PostgreSQL database. This will provide:

- Better type safety and migration management
- More control over database schema and optimization
- Reduced vendor lock-in
- Better integration with our domain-driven design architecture
