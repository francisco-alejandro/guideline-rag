# ADR-0006: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

## Title

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application needs to handle both write operations (commands) and read operations (queries) efficiently. Currently, both operations are performed by the same process, but we need to prepare for future scalability requirements:

- **Scalability**: Ability to scale read and write operations independently
- **Semantic Search**: Need to support semantic similarity queries which may require different database technologies than our primary PostgreSQL instance
- **Performance**: Optimize read and write operations separately based on their specific requirements
- **Flexibility**: Allow different data models and storage strategies for commands and queries

## Decision

We will implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate command and query responsibilities. This decision includes:

1. **Command Side**: Handle write operations (create, update, delete) through command handlers
2. **Query Side**: Handle read operations through dedicated query handlers
3. **Current Implementation**: Commands and queries run in the same process initially
4. **Future Scalability**: Prepare for async command processing with message brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis)
5. **Semantic Search**: Enable query-side to use specialized databases for vector similarity search

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Independent Scaling**: Can scale command and query sides separately based on load
- **Optimized Models**: Different data models for read and write operations
- **Future Flexibility**: Easy to introduce async processing and message brokers
- **Semantic Search Ready**: Query side can use specialized vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
- **Performance**: Optimize each side for its specific use case
- **Maintainability**: Clearer code organization and easier testing

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Additional architectural complexity and learning curve
- **Data Consistency**: Potential eventual consistency issues between command and query sides
- **Development Overhead**: More code to maintain and test
- **Eventual Consistency**: Read models may be slightly stale compared to write models
- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Future message broker setup and maintenance

### Neutral

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand CQRS patterns and best practices
- **Migration Path**: Gradual migration from current synchronous to future asynchronous processing

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Synchronous CQRS

- Implement command and query handlers in the same process
- Separate command and query models
- Maintain immediate consistency

### Phase 2: Async Command Processing

- Introduce message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka/Redis)
- Implement async command handlers
- Add event sourcing for command side

### Phase 3: Specialized Query Database

- Implement semantic search with vector database
- Optimize query models for specific use cases
- Add read model synchronization

## Alternatives Considered

- **Traditional CRUD**: Rejected due to lack of scalability and semantic search capabilities
- **Single Database**: Rejected due to limitations with semantic search and scaling

## Technical Considerations

### Message Brokers

- **RabbitMQ**: Good for reliable message delivery and complex routing
- **Kafka**: Excellent for high-throughput event streaming
- **Redis**: Lightweight option for simple pub/sub patterns
